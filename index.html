      <h1 class="subhead">Gaming</h1>
      <p class="hobby-info">My first main hobby is gaming. I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember, making it my longest spanning hobby. I feel as though gaming has had a pretty major impact on my life. First of all, it has always been my go to way to destress as it allows me to disconnect from reality for a bit. Second of all, it has led to me meeting many of my closest friends today. Lastly, I honestly believe that gaming is what first sparked my interest in computers. It might just be the root of the reason for why I am studying what I am studying. Below are some of my favorite games that I have ever played.</p>

              <h2>Borderlands 2</h2>
              <p class="card-text">When I was younger and I first got my Xbox 360, this was the first game that I played on it. I absolutely love this game. Its characters, story, and gameplay are all amazing. However, the thing that stands out about this game the most is its dark sense of humor, which fits very well. Because of this sense of humor, it doesnt really take itself too serious which makes it a blast to play.</p>

              <h2>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
              <p class="card-text">I have a very big love/hate relationship with this game. I love this game because of how much fun I have had playing this game with my friends, 1,600 hours of fun to be exact. I have also met a couple of my good friends through this game, which makes it special to me. However, on the otherhand, this game is infuriating to my friends and I, largely due to the developer. It is probably one of the most consistantly buggy and unbalanced games that we have played, yet it is so addicting. It is a game that has some of the highest highs and lowest lows.</p>

              <h2>Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>
              <p class="card-text">This is a game that I have always known for being an amazing game, yet I had never played until recently. I am so glad that I did. While the gameplay itself can get a bit repetitive, everything else about this game definitely makes up for it. The graphics in this game are some of the most stunning graphics I have ever seen. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. However, most importantly, the characters and story make this game one of the best that I have ever played.</p>

      <h1 class="subhead">Warhammer</h1>
      <p class="hobby-info"> My second main hobby is playing a tabletop game called Warhammer 40K with my friends. I have only been into 40K for about a year as of this point, yet it has quickly become one of my favorite things to do. I enjoy all aspects of the hobby, from building the models, painting the models, reading the lore, and playing the game itself. I would try to explain the story behind 40k, yet that could easily take multiple pages to explain. However, I definitely recommend checking it out as it has some of the best story writing I have ever read. The tabletop game on the otherhand is a lot easier to explain. In short, you collect and build models that each have unique rules. Each model costs a certain number of points to field and you build up an army depending on how many points are going to be used in a game. For example, an average game is 2,000 points for each person, so if I add up the points cost of every model in my army, they must be less than or equal to 2,000 points. After each person has their armies, they fight each other using the rules that their models have. There are a lot more specifics than that, but this is just a brief description. My favorite aspect of this hobby is painting the miniatures. It's both relaxing and rewarding at the same time. I don't even know how many times I have spent a night listening to music and painting models. It honestly has the same impact that gaming does, it also allows me to disconnect from reality for a bit. It's also really nice to spend a couple of hours painting and have something completed that I painted myself. Plus, it really does make the experience of playing 40K on tabletop a lot more immersive than if I had unpainted models. However, probably the most important part of this hobby for me is that it reignited my creativity. When I was younger, I used to love sketching and painting, but I slowly lost my creativity and passion for it, which I believe to be partially caused by gaming. Yet, painting these miniatures has helped reignite that passion and creativity, which I truely am glad about. Below are some of my favorite models that I have painted up till this point.</p>

      <h1 class="subhead">Favorite Songs/Bands</h1>
      <p class="hobby-info">My third main hobby is listening to music. I don't know if many people would call this a hobby, but I certainly do. I have always loved listening to music and it has definitely impacted my life significantly. When I was younger, I did not really have any specific genre that I listened to. However, as of the past couple of years, I have fallen in love with the metal genre and many of its subgenres, such as progressive metal and heavy metal. I think that the best part of this hobby is how accessible it is compared to my other hobbies. With gaming, I have to be at home. With playing 40K, my friends and I have to set up a time and go to a game store. With painting, I also have to be at home. Meanwhile, with music I can listen to it at anytime and while doing anything. Below are some of my favorite bands as of right now.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Gojira is a French heavy metal band. This band has much heavier vocals than I usually listen to. While they are good, the main reason that I love this band is the heavy instrumentals. Here are some of my favorite songs by them:</p>

              <p class="card-text">Between the Buried and Me is an American progressive metal band. They have a very good mixture of heavy and clean vocals, which I really like. They also have some amazing instrumentals. However, the best part of this band is how well the songs flow between one another in an album, so I definitely recommend listening to albums in their entirety. Here are some of my favorite individual songs by them though: </p>
